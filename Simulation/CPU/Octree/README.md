   2. Where to build the binaries: Octree/build

   3. Select "Configure"

      1. Select Visual studio 2017 (15)
   
      2. For the platform use "x64" (changed from Win32)
   4. Select "Generate"
   5. Done, you can now "Open Project" go directly to your code

# Running project

If configure and generate was done correctly, you can open and just use any IDE to run the project
